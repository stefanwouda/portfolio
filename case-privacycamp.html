                    <p>Hero Balancer, founded in 2017, makes existing large-scale heating installations in, for example, schools, showrooms, or offices smarter. By controlling the heating more efficiently using their software, a building can save up to 40% in energy consumption. As a result, the energy bill is lower. Also, it is good for the environment: less CO2 is emitted. When purchasing a Hero Balancer, a customer gets access to an online dashboard that provides insight into the energy consumption (electricity and gas) and the temperature history of a building. Also, the user can configure heating schedules to set when a building must be heated. </p>

                    <p>Privacy is becoming an important issue in our daily lives.
                        We communicate all day long by e-mail, WhatsApp and social media like Instagram. The
                        applications on our smartphone make everyday life easier and more
                        efficient. However, we often do not realize that we give away our data for free
                        to the companies behind these applications. </p>

                    <p>So, Hero Balancer wants to become the best cloud building management system on the market. The dashboard can help with this, but how? A logical first step was to conduct a competitive analysis. Hero Balancer is far from the only company doing something with smart heating systems. Most of them also provide a dashboard or app with their product. The competitive analysis showed me that there are two types of smart heating products on the market.</p>

                    <p>When it was clear what the requirements of the stakeholders were and where the current dashboard could be improved, it was time to generate ideas. I created a list of all the data collected by a Hero Balancer and designed several UI elements and variations to test which data and which way of presenting the data to users worked best. No interactive prototypes yet, during this test round I wanted to test purely for functionality to get even more clear what users wanted to see in the dashboard. This way of working proved to be very efficient afterward.</p>

                    <p>This could be done in this way, where the results of the Hero Balancer can be shown as to how much someone has saved in euros, together with the amount of CO2 that has not been emitted. A metaphor is used to support the amount of CO2 to give the user a better idea of the amount of CO2 saved. I tested this on users. The test revealed that users wanted to know how this savings calculation was done. Users also wish to see gas and electricity consumption separately. Users liked the metaphor though. It helps them to better understand the data. </p>

                    <p>A Hero Balancer partly solves this problem by, for example, adjusting the heating based on weather forecasts. However, it can happen that due to extreme external influences, for example, a bright sun on a window, an unpleasant indoor climate still arises in a part of a building. The sensors of Hero Balancer can detect this and communicate this to the user via the dashboard.</p>

                    <p>Applying this to the dashboard turned out to be very valuable to the user. The indoor climate of a building can be made transparent via the dashboard. Also, the user can be notified with a notification when the indoor climate in a room is not optimal. The user can get helped to improve the indoor climate. In the image above you can see different UI elements that I tested with users. During the test, users were very enthusiastic about this functionality. It became clear that users find it very valuable when they have more control over the indoor climate in their building. As mentioned earlier, a bad indoor climate is often a problem, especially in schools, the majority of Hero Balancer's customers. A healthy indoor climate has a positive impact on the health of people in a building. Also, it helps with reducing the spread of COVID-19.</p>

Below the bar chart are some so-called highlights that communicate this. The app does more than plotting graphs.

                    <h3>Insights into the results by Hero Balancer</h3>
                    <p>The final product contains the 'energy' page with summaries of the data collected by Hero Balancer regarding the energy consumption in a building. The bar graph chart is used to show how much Hero Balancer has saved in a building by comparing historical energy consumption with current consumption. Except for the 'Electricity' tab. There, only the current electricity consumption is shown because Hero Balancer does not save on electricity. Research has shown, however, that some of the users wish to view this data. That is why electricity consumption is shown in the end product. The data shown is supported by highlights at the bottom of the graph. For the user, this provides a better understanding of the displayed data.</p>

                    <h3>Helping the user keeping the indoor climate comfortable</h3>
                    <p>When one of the factors (temperature, CO2 level, humidity) that influence the indoor climate is not optimal, the user will receive a notification on his phone regarding the current situation. See this video that further demonstrates the interaction with the new dashboard. Thanks to this, the user gets more control over the indoor climate in a building.</p>

                    <h3>Providing a clear overview of the indoor climate in a building.</h3>
                    <p>The new dashboard also gives users a better overview of the status of the indoor climate in their building. In addition to the notifications for an uncomfortable indoor climate, the user can view the current status of the indoor climate at any time. See this video showing interaction with the new dashboard. The new dashboard provides more grip on the indoor climate.</p>

                    <h2>What do users think of the new dashboard?</h2>
                    <p>A few weeks before the end of this project, I validated the interactive prototype of the new dashboard by conducting several usability tests with users. The results of these usability tests were very positive. Users found the new dashboard a big improvement over the current one. It offers great added value to the user. The new dashboard gives users a better insight into the results of the Hero Balancer. Also, it provides the user with more grip over the indoor climate in a building.</p>

                    <p>The new dashboard is a huge improvement over the current one. It has been confirmed several times that the new Hero Balancer dashboard can help fulfill the dream of becoming the best cloud building management system. The new dashboard is an excellent match between Hero Balancer's goals as a company and the wishes of users. I am very proud of the result.</p>
